# EU-Taxonomy-Compliance-Checker

## Project Overview
This repository contains the development and structure for the EU Taxonomy Compliance Checker, an application designed to assess financial contracts for eligibility and alignment with the EU Taxonomy framework.

## Repository Structure
### genAi Folder â€“ Web Development (Frontend Only)

The genAi folder contains the web development part of the application:

-The frontend structure (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, etc.).

-UI components, styling, and layout.

-No backend functionality is included in this section.

### Jupyter Notebook â€“ Compliance Checker Logic (Prototype)
The Jupyter Notebook contains:

-The AI-powered logic for checking eligibility and alignment.

-Implementation of text similarity analysis using TF-IDF and AI.

-The logic of how the checker will work, but not fully operational yet.

### Next Steps
Integrate full backend functionality into the web application.

Connect the AI processing from Jupyter to the web interface.

Finalize compliance automation for financial contracts.

###  How to Use
1.To explore the web development, check the genAi folder.

2.To understand how the checker will work, review the Jupyter Notebook.

3.For full functionality, future updates will integrate both sections.
